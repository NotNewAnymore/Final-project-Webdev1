            <h3>3D art</h3>
            <p>This is the website where I post 3d art projects I'm proud of. Throughout the 2010's, I grew increasingly tired of 3d animaiton and artwork.
                Major movie studios always either copied Pixar, or went for total realism. Realism is impressive, but the whole point is that it is not
                 noticed, and although the Pixar style is good, seeing the same thing over and over again is boring. And then, in the late 2010's, I saw
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tktcOUi-x-A">Bacterial Contamination</a>, A somewhat disturbing 3d animated music video by Deino, who is now my favorite 3d artist.
                This, combined with some 3d animations made in Source Film Maker with TF2 characters and extremely exaggerated experssions, made me realize
                that the potential of 3d animation has been being ignored in mainstream animation. So, I set out to learn Blender.

            <h3>Game development</h3>
            <p>
                Pretty quickly, I realized that although I like 3d modelling, making movies is not for me. Around 2020, I played The Citadel and Touhou: Hidden Star In Four Seasons
                for the first time. Both of these are good games made by one person. And I figured if Doekuramori could make the best FPS, and ZUN
                could make the most popular vertically scrolling Bullet Hell series of the 2010's, I could probably make something decent. And so, for
                A year, I tried, and failed. Attempting to make an optimized game using Pixel Game Maker MV turned out to be more than I could handle.
                So I'm learning programming at Renton Technical college right now.

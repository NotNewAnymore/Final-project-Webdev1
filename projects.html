                    <p>This is the main menu background for a game I was working on, but cancelled once school started.
                        I was learning a lot about geometry nodes, which I used to make the floor, and UV mapping, which
                        I used to make the character's clothes.

                <h2>Heretical mage-knight</h2>
                <p> For this project, I didn't learn all that much. I was mostly just refining previous ideas and skills.
                    The wings were very complicated to make, everything in them but the frame was made with geometry nodes.
                    The robot arm and hand was also very fun to design, getting a decent degree of mobility was tricky.
                    The gun has a one inch barrel diameter, and probably weights over 100 pounds.

                <h2>Mage-knight</h2>
                <p> With this project, I was experimenting with belts. My main inspirations were goth fashion, John Blanche illustrations, and Sailor Moon.
                    This character is a mage-knight, which are a sort of policing force in the distant future. Their main task is to ensure nobody considered
                    "impure" uses magic. This is mostly cyborgs, and anybody who wants to mix magic and advanced technology. The background is mostly
                    made using more geometry nodes, it's a bunch of reflective rectangular prisims in a grid with randomly assigned altitudes.

                <h2>Abstract thing</h2>
                <p> I made this for a card for my mom's birthday. I was experimenting with reflections. This image is taken from between many layers of a glass
                    shader, in a strangely shaped room made with a metallic shader. Between the layers of glass are psudo-random glowing lines. A notable thing
                    about this and most of the other projects on this website are that I had to carefully tune the raycasting properties that Blender used,
                    as too few reflections resulted in an overly simple image, and too many took too long and left too little black space.

                <h2>Shader experiment</h2>
                <p> This was a quick experiment I did with Blender's material nodes. Blender can treat different kinds of rays differently. In this case, camera
                    rays hitting the square treat it as a red reflective object, and reflection rays hitting it treat it as a glowing blue object.

                <p> This is a spaceship I modelled for my Programming 3 final. I needed a background for it. I designed it with the help of my brother, who's getting
                    a job at Boeing. This is a high speed gas transport ship.
